                        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
                        that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
                        My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
                        for.<br/>I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual,
                        but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike."The Mentor"

                        Ever since a kid i've been in love with technology, During the past year i've dedicated my life to learning computer systems, here's my journey. When i was about 13 year's old, my parents bought me an ipod touch which was the first implementation of Apple's touch screen display. After many school night's scrolling through YouTube i've stumbled upon a video tittled "ipod touch jailbreak", 13 year old me wasn't really sure what the phrase "jailbreak" really meant. Twenty minutes into the video i was amazed by the concept of jailbreak's, and all the things you were able to do with a jailbroken device.
